# Codsoft Internship Tasks

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've completed five tasks as part of my internship at Codsoft. Each task serves as a demonstration of my programming skills and knowledge.

## Task 1: Todo List

The Todo List program allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It includes features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks. The tasks are saved to a JSON file for persistent storage between sessions.

## Task 2: Calculator

The Calculator program is a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation. It provides user-friendly error messages for division by zero and modulo by zero.

## Task 3: Password Generator

The Password Generator program generates strong and customizable passwords. Users can specify the length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters) for the password. The generated passwords are random and secure.

## Task 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game is an interactive game where users can play against the computer. Users choose one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the program determines the winner. The score is kept, and the user can play multiple rounds.

The Contact Book program allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. It provides features like adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts. Contacts are stored with their name, phone number, email, and address.
